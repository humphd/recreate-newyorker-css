# WEB222 CSS Week 8 Walkthrough: Recreate a New Yorker Article

In this [video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAtHHDVsGAY) we use the basic CSS text styling we learn in
[WEB222 Week 8](https://web222.ca/weeks/week08/) to make an HTML
document look like [this New Yorker article](https://www.newyorker.com/sports/sporting-scene/the-blockbuster-video-game-that-wants-to-make-america-whole-again).
